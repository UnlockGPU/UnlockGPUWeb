# Shareholder Activism: How You Can Force Real Change in Public Companies

This campaign harnesses a powerful but often overlooked mechanism: **shareholder activism**. Here we outline precisely how shareholder activism works, how we're strategically deploying it, and why the involvement of developers uniquely amplifies our impact.

## What Is Shareholder Activism?

Shareholder activism occurs when investors leverage their ownership stakes in a company to formally propose changes directly to its management. This involves submitting resolutions, advocating publicly, and mobilizing votes during annual shareholder meetings.

## Real-World Examples of Impact

**Elliott Management at Salesforce (2023):** Elliott Management, a high-profile activist investor, compelled Salesforce to adopt substantial operational reforms by submitting detailed resolutions and mobilizing public and shareholder support.

**Engine No. 1 at ExxonMobil (2021):** Despite holding only 0.02% of shares, Engine No. 1 managed to elect three new board members to ExxonMobil by clearly articulating climate-related issues, rallying institutional investors, and harnessing public visibility.

## A Note on the GameStop Phenomenon

The 2021 GameStop saga showed that coordinated internet mobilization can profoundly impact financial markets. UnlockGPU channels that same collaborative spirit—but with technical expertise and legitimate shareholder activism instead of speculation.

## How Shareholder Activism Works

### 1. Filing Shareholder Resolutions

Any shareholder meeting SEC criteria can submit resolutions:

- Must own at least $2,000 of stock for at least one year
- Submit a concise (max 500-word) resolution specifying requested actions
- Comply with SEC procedural guidelines ([details here](https://www.sec.gov/rules-regulations))

While UnlockGPU meets these criteria, securing a well-known institutional or activist investor to file the resolution significantly boosts visibility and influence, amplifying our campaign's credibility and media exposure.

### 2. Voting on Resolutions

All shareholders, large or small, can vote on resolutions:

- Votes typically happen electronically via broker websites or through [proxyvote.com](https://proxyvote.com)
- Instructions for voting arrive ahead of annual shareholder meetings
- **UnlockGPU.org** (launching soon) will coordinate shareholder voting efforts for maximum turnout and effectiveness

### 3. Coalition Building

Successful campaigns combine multiple strengths:

- **Developers and Users** provide crucial technical legitimacy and clearly defined real-world needs, making proposals compelling and credible
- **Activist Investors and Institutions** add strategic clout and amplify pressure through financial expertise and public engagement
- **Media Attention** highlights the issues, increases scrutiny, and incentivizes management action

## Why We Don't Need a Majority Vote to Win

Success in shareholder activism doesn't require outright majority support. Even minority votes of 10–20% can exert significant pressure because they:

- Signal serious unresolved problems, posing reputational risks management can't easily dismiss
- Draw attention from media, analysts, and institutional investors, increasing scrutiny and forcing the company to respond
- Empower internal advocates within AMD by providing visible, external validation of their concerns
- Allow continuous pressure through annual shareholder meetings until meaningful action is taken

Engine No. 1's victory at ExxonMobil vividly demonstrated that a minority shareholding, when strategically mobilized, can catalyze transformative change.

## Developer Involvement: Our Unique Leverage

What distinguishes UnlockGPU from typical activist campaigns is the deep involvement of developers. By clearly articulating specific technical problems, developers give our campaign unmatched authenticity and urgency. Developer involvement:

- **Adds technical credibility**, making it harder for AMD's management to dismiss demands as purely financial or activist-driven
- **Attracts media and analyst attention** by highlighting genuine, practical issues that impact AMD's business prospects
- **Strengthens the case** for major institutional or activist investors to join, amplifying our influence

UnlockGPU is actively mobilizing this combined developer-investor coalition, preparing a compelling resolution and positioning for maximum impact at AMD's 2026 shareholder meeting.

## How You Can Help

**Developers:** Participate by acquiring shares, contributing your technical insights, and voting.

**Investors:** Join the coalition, vote your shares, and publicly support the campaign.

Together, leveraging our unique blend of technical credibility and strategic financial pressure, we can compel AMD to prioritize critical software improvements—unlocking massive potential value for everyone.
