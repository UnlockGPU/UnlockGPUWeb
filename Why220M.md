# Why $220M: Justifying the Budget to Unlock AMD's Software Potential

## Executive Summary

AMD's hardware is competitive. But its software stack—drivers, tools, libraries, and ecosystem support—remains the critical bottleneck to developer trust and broader adoption. We propose a bold but credible demand:

- ✅ $200 million/year for core GPU software and platform development
- ✅ $20 million/year for developer community engagement and support

This is not a moonshot—it is a correction. A right-sizing of AMD's priorities to match the scale of the opportunity and the intensity of developer frustration.

## 1. The CUDA Benchmark: What AMD Is Up Against

NVIDIA has spent over a decade building CUDA into the default compute platform. While NVIDIA does not break out CUDA-specific expenses, analysts estimate:

- **NVIDIA R&D (2024)**: ~$8 billion
- **Estimated CUDA ecosystem budget**: $500M–1B/year
- **Covers**: dev tools, library engineering, profiling/debugging, docs, and DevRel

This investment underwrites a dominant, polished developer experience.

## 2. AMD's Opportunity—and the Gap

AMD's ROCm stack shows promising hardware alignment (e.g., MI300, MI350), but software remains immature and underfunded:

| Area | Status | Needed |
|------|--------|---------|
| Drivers (Adrenalin, ROCm) | Still fragile, esp. on Windows | Full regression/test matrix, automation, diagnostics |
| Libraries & Tools | Missing parity (e.g., FlashAttention, RCCL) | Re-architecture, upstream work |
| Installation & Docs | Confusing, error-prone | Seamless tooling, beginner kits |
| DevRel & Community | Weak institutional support | Grants, bug bounties, onboarding incentives |

A $200M/year investment is required to address these systematically and rebuild trust.

## 3. Budget Breakdown

| Category | Est. Annual Budget |
|----------|-------------------|
| ROCm core engineering (HIP, libraries) | $80M |
| Driver QA and ecosystem robustness | $40M |
| Tooling, docs, and diagnostics | $30M |
| Compatibility tooling, containers, devcloud | $30M |
| Community engagement (bug bounties, OSS grants, onboarding) | $20M |
| **Total** | **$200M + $20M** |

This is consistent with an internal VP-led division of 300–400 engineers, support staff, and developer relations.

## 4. Comparison to Other AMD Divisions

- **AMD R&D (2024)**: ~$6 billion
- **Proposed Open Compute Software budget**: ~3.5% of total R&D
- **Xilinx integration and Adaptive Compute division** likely consumes >$1B/year

This makes the proposed budget significant but proportionate, and gives real operational teeth to a VP for Open Compute Software.

## 5. Strategic Rationale: It Pays for Itself

Investing in open software isn't just altruism—it's leverage:

- Unlock billions in Instinct GPU sales
- Lower customer acquisition cost via better DX
- Reduce churn from developer frustration
- Increase visibility and trust in enterprise markets
- Break vendor lock-in and shift industry norms toward openness

Failing to fund this effort risks repeating a decade of missed opportunities.

## 6. Transparency and Accountability

We recommend that this budget be:

- Ring-fenced from short-term cost-cutting
- Reported publicly, with annual progress updates
- Directed by a VP-level executive with board visibility and developer input
- Informed by community feedback, including a formal advisory board

## Conclusion

We ask AMD to match its hardware ambition with software execution. $200 million per year is the minimum credible investment to close the trust gap, build a real CUDA alternative, and unlock latent GPU demand across AI, HPC, and grassroots developers.
