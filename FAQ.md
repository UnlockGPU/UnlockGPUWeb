## Q: What actual force do you have over AMD? How can a few people change a billion-dollar company?

**A:**

We're not just making noise—we're using formal shareholder activism, which is fundamentally different from internet petitions.

**The barrier is surprisingly low:** Anyone owning just $2,000 of AMD stock for one year can file a shareholder resolution. We already meet these requirements.

**Why resolutions matter:** Unlike petitions, shareholder resolutions are formal corporate governance that:
- Get mandatory inclusion in proxy statements sent to all shareholders
- Require board response and public disclosure
- Generate media coverage because they're real corporate actions, not just online campaigns
- Even minority votes of 10-20% create significant pressure and force management attention

**Real precedent:** Engine No. 1 successfully changed ExxonMobil's board with only 0.02% ownership by combining technical credibility with strategic activism.

Our unique advantage is combining developer expertise with investor pressure—making our demands technically credible and financially legitimate.

## Q: Why not target NVIDIA directly? Isn't NVIDIA the real problem? Why focus on AMD when they already support open source?

**A:**

NVIDIA's CUDA monopoly is the core problem—it creates vendor lock-in, inflates prices, and blocks open AI/scientific computing. We absolutely want open GPU computing free from single-vendor control.

However, NVIDIA only responds to real competition, not public pressure. Years of calls to "open up CUDA" have been ignored because their monopoly works and their platform "just works."

AMD is the only realistic challenger with both the hardware and open-source commitment. But AMD's current "openness" isn't enough:

- Software experience (drivers, libraries, ease of use) lags far behind NVIDIA
- Developers face broken workflows, missing features, and limited support
- Community verdict: "Open source" is just marketing unless tools actually work

### Why focus on AMD?

NVIDIA's monopoly will only break when a credible, open alternative exists. The fastest path is pushing AMD to deliver on their potential—fixing software, expanding support, and earning developer trust.

Our campaign demands execution, not promises. We're pushing AMD to be truly competitive, not just "open."

### If AMD delivers, everyone wins:

- Prices drop and the "CUDA tax" disappears
- Open science and AI become accessible to more people
- NVIDIA is forced to compete or open up

### Bottom line:

AMD is the only company with a realistic path to break NVIDIA's monopoly—but only if they fix what's broken. When AMD wins, we all win.

## Q: Doesn't AMD already know all of this? Why should an external campaign be necessary?

**A:**

It's true—AMD's leadership understands the CUDA monopoly, the market opportunity, and the need for a competitive open-source software stack. They talk about it in interviews, investor calls, and press releases. They know what needs fixing.

So why is outside pressure still needed?

**Knowing ≠ Doing.** Big organizations often struggle to turn knowledge into action. AMD has known about these problems for years—but progress has been slow and inconsistent.

**Credibility Gap.** Developers and investors have been burned by broken promises and missed timelines. There's a lack of trust that AMD will deliver without public accountability.

**Internal Pressures.** Like any large company, AMD has shifting priorities, competing departments, and budget constraints. It's easy for crucial software work to be delayed or cut—unless there's a strong outside signal that the world is watching.

**Independent Oversight Creates Results.** Think of credit rating agencies: every company knows it should manage its debt, but ratings still matter—because external scrutiny affects access to capital, board decisions, and even executive compensation. The same is true for open software at AMD: public, independent evaluation makes it a top priority, not just an internal talking point.

**Proven Track Record.** In tech, real change—open drivers, better standards, security audits—almost always follows sustained, external, community or investor pressure. It's rarely just the result of internal insight.

**In short:**
We're not here to "educate" AMD. We're here to create the public, independent accountability that finally moves the needle. Even when management knows the right answer, external pressure and oversight are what turn promises into progress.
