# Unlock the GPU # A Manifesto for a developer-Led Investor Campaign for Open
# Compute and AMD Shareholder Value

## Why This Matters

NVIDIA's CUDA ecosystem has monopolized the GPU computing market for over a
decade, letting one company dictate prices and pace of innovation. Developers
know the pain: AMD's promising hardware is held back by software and ecosystem
gaps—driver instability, poor compatibility, and a confusing, fragmented stack.
As a result, programmers are forced to buy NVIDIA, and AMD's huge potential
remains untapped.

This chronic gap is clear to every engineer who has tried to port code or build
AI on AMD. Yet, financial markets remain slow to recognize the scale of this
opportunity: AMD's valuation does not reflect what could be unlocked if it
became the default alternative to CUDA. There is a disconnect between what
developers experience daily and what investors expect. This is why we need a
developer-led investor campaign—to make the value case impossible to ignore.

## The Investment Opportunity

- **The "Nvidia Tax"**: NVIDIA's monopoly lets it charge up to 5x over hardware
cost. Enterprises, researchers, and cloud providers desperately want a credible
alternative.

- **AMD's Hidden Potential**: AMD hardware already offers leading
price/performance. Closing the software gap—making ROCm and HIP as seamless as
CUDA—would unlock billions in new sales, data center wins, and ecosystem
momentum.

- **Rising Demand**: AI, ML, and scientific computing are exploding. Even modest
progress on AMD's stack would yield outsized returns.

- **Activist Leverage**: Shareholder and developer pressure can catalyze the
management changes and focused investment AMD needs to seize this moment.


## Bridging the Trust Gap

AMD's GPU hardware is strong — often offering better price/performance than
NVIDIA. But its software efforts, despite being open-source and
well-intentioned, have left developers frustrated. From broken drivers to
missing features and inconsistent support, the community has been burned too
many times.

Still, recent changes — including new libraries and hints of leadership focus —
suggest a turnaround might be possible. But trust isn't built with code alone.
It takes transparency, continuity, and accountability.

Our campaign exists to help AMD rebuild that trust. We believe AMD's management
wants to win back developer goodwill — and that this campaign can help them do
it faster, more credibly, and more visibly.

We're not just calling for investment. We're offering a structure of support: a
coalition of developers and shareholders ready to rally behind real change. By
combining developer insight with investor leverage, we can help AMD finally
deliver on its promise — and show the world that this time is different.

## Our Demands

1. **Substantial Dedicated Investment**: Commit to and publicly report a significant, protected annual budget for ROCm and open GPU software—matching the scale of the challenge.

2. **Leadership and Transparency**: Appoint a VP for Open Compute Software with board visibility, publish a clear software roadmap, and report progress quarterly.

3. **Community Engagement**: Form an external developer/customer advisory board and fund hackathons, bug bounties, and innovation grants.

## Preliminary Action Plan

*This plan is a starting point—join us to shape and refine it further.*

- **Shareholder Action**: Draft and submit a non-binding resolution for AMD's 2026 annual meeting, engaging legal experts and activist investors (Elliott Management, Third Point) for maximum impact.

- **Developer Coalition**: Organize the #UnlockGPU campaign, engage prominent figures in GPU computing, and build a unified voice demanding specific technical improvements.

- **Strategic Pressure**: Monitor and demand quarterly progress reporting while advocating for AMD to collaborate with Intel, cloud providers, and open-source leaders on cross-vendor standards and tools.

## How to Join

### For Developers
- **Document Technical Pain Points**: Share specific ROCm/HIP issues, compatibility gaps, and missing features that block adoption
- **Contribute to Resolution Drafting**: Help define technical requirements and proposed solutions for the shareholder resolution
- **Amplify #UnlockGPU**: Share experiences and build technical consensus around needed improvements

### For Shareholders
- **Buy AMD Stock**: Purchase shares through your broker to gain voting rights
- **Vote and Engage**: Use proxy votes at AGMs, submit proposals, and attend meetings (virtual or in-person)
- **Register Support**: Sign up at UnlockGPU.org *(coming soon)* for coordination and updates

### For Activist Investors
- **Strategic Partnership**: Join forces with campaign organizers to maximize shareholder pressure and provide strategic guidance
- **Shape the Agenda**: Contribute expertise on effective resolution language, timing, media strategy, and board engagement tactics
- **Leverage Networks**: Connect the campaign with other institutional investors, analysts, and industry allies

## The Payoff

- **Unlock billions** in shareholder value as AMD wins market share from NVIDIA.

- **Lead a historic transformation**—ending GPU vendor lock-in and opening up
compute for all.

- **Ensure the future** of AI, ML, and scientific research is built on open,
competitive, and developer-friendly foundations.
