# Unlock the GPU 

### A Manifesto for a Developer–Investor Alliance to Open Compute and Unleash AMD's Value

## The Three-Part Problem

NVIDIA's CUDA monopoly traps the GPU world. AMD has the hardware to compete—but software, trust, and perception barriers keep it locked out. This crisis has three parts:

**1. Developers Know What's Broken, But Don't Trust AMD**

Every GPU developer knows the story: AMD's hardware delivers, but the software ecosystem is fractured. Instability, poor compatibility, incomplete tools, and years of broken promises have killed trust. We know exactly what needs fixing—seamless installs, stable drivers, true CUDA parity, real docs—but AMD's track record says "don't get your hopes up."

**2. AMD Understands the Opportunity, But Can't Rebuild Trust Alone**

AMD's leadership understands what's at stake. Billions in revenue, cloud/data center wins, and a shot at breaking NVIDIA's grip. But years of software failure created a credibility gap no press release can fix. Developers tune out the promises. Progress, if any, is lost in the noise. AMD needs independent validation and accountability.

**3. Financial Markets Don't Understand the Technical Bottleneck**

Wall Street sees great AMD hardware and wonders: why are sales flat? They miss the real barrier—the broken software ecosystem. The market assumes CUDA dominance is unbreakable, not realizing AMD's obstacles are fixable, given the right investment and follow-through.

## Why This Campaign Works

NVIDIA's monopoly is only breakable when real, open competition exists. Our campaign targets AMD because it's the only challenger with the hardware and open approach to actually change the game—if they deliver on software and trust.

Our campaign creates a unified feedback loop: developer requirements **build trust** through technical legitimacy, shareholder actions **create accountability** that can't be ignored or spun, and we **educate markets** about the fixable bottleneck and massive opportunity.

We understand that ecosystem dominance starts from the grassroots. Support for affordable, widely available GPUs is the foundation of a strong developer ecosystem. Many breakthrough tools—like Stable Diffusion and llama.cpp—started as solo hacker projects on accessible hardware. Without grassroots adoption, there is no ecosystem. Consumer support drives enterprise adoption, not the reverse.

Unlike typical open source advocacy campaigns that suffer from chronic underfunding and volunteer burnout, this campaign is potentially hugely lucrative for participants. If AMD's software ecosystem improves and breaks NVIDIA's monopoly, shareholders could see massive returns as AMD captures market share in the exploding AI/compute sector. While the created value will be difficult to capture entirely by the campaign participants, the scale will be enormous—creating powerful financial incentives for sustained campaign participation and investment.

This is not just advocacy. It's a strategic framework for real change. We don't need big resources to do that - see [How do we actually have force over AMD?](/faq#actual-force)

*(For developers unfamiliar with shareholder activism tactics, see our [detailed explanation](/shareholder-activism) of how this strategy works in practice.)*

## The Investment Opportunity

- The "Nvidia Tax": NVIDIA charges up to 5x hardware cost—because it can.
- AMD's Hidden Potential: The hardware is strong; the missing piece is a seamless, developer-friendly stack.
- Exploding Demand: The AI/compute boom means any AMD software win translates into major market gains.
- Market Mispricing: The market doesn't yet price in what happens when AMD fixes the software bottleneck. The upside is enormous for early movers. 

## Our Demands

1. **Guaranteed Investment in Open GPU Software**
Allocate a protected annual budget of $200 million specifically for ROCm development, driver stability, and CUDA compatibility tools, with funds ring-fenced from general R&D cuts. This budget must be maintained for a minimum of 5 years and reported separately in quarterly earnings calls.

2. **Mandatory Driver Support for Consumer Hardware**
Provide full ROCm support for all consumer GPUs from RX 6000 series onward within 12 months, with commit-level guarantees for 5-year support lifecycles. Establish and fund a dedicated consumer GPU software team with measurable performance targets.

3. **Binding Community Governance Structure**
Create a Developer Advisory Board with voting rights on ROCm roadmap priorities, funded by a dedicated $20 million annual community engagement budget. Board members must include representatives from major open-source AI frameworks. Publish binding quarterly progress reports against community-defined milestones.

4. **Executive Accountability and Public Commitment**
Appoint a VP of Open Compute Software reporting directly to the CEO, with compensation tied to measurable ecosystem adoption metrics. Publish binding quarterly roadmaps with specific feature delivery dates, penalty clauses for missed targets, and public developer satisfaction scores.

Here is our rationale for the proposed budget:[Why $220M?](why_220M.md)

## Preliminary Action Plan

*This plan is a starting point—join us to shape and refine it further. But some parts of it will happen regardless of the support we gain.*
- Shareholder Action: File a non-binding resolution at AMD's 2026 meeting. Enlist activist investor allies.
- Developer Coalition: Launch #UnlockGPU, unite developer voices, and prioritize a technical wishlist.
- Strategic Pressure: Demand quarterly progress and push for AMD to collaborate on open, cross-vendor standards (SYCL, etc.).
