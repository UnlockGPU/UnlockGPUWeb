# Unlock the GPU 

### A Manifesto for a Developer–Investor Alliance to Open Compute and Unleash AMD’s Value

## The Three-Part Problem

NVIDIA’s CUDA monopoly traps the GPU world. AMD has the hardware to compete—but software, trust, and perception barriers keep it locked out. This crisis has three parts:

**1. Developers Know What's Broken, But Don't Trust AMD**

Every GPU developer knows the story: AMD’s hardware delivers, but the software ecosystem is fractured. Instability, poor compatibility, incomplete tools, and years of broken promises have killed trust. We know exactly what needs fixing—seamless installs, stable drivers, true CUDA parity, real docs—but AMD’s track record says “don’t get your hopes up.”

**2. AMD Understands the Opportunity, But Can't Rebuild Trust Alone**

AMD’s leadership understands what’s at stake. Billions in revenue, cloud/data center wins, and a shot at breaking NVIDIA’s grip. But years of software failure created a credibility gap no press release can fix. Developers tune out the promises. Progress, if any, is lost in the noise. AMD needs independent validation and accountability.

**3. Financial Markets Don't Understand the Technical Bottleneck**

Wall Street sees great AMD hardware and wonders: why are sales flat? They miss the real barrier—the broken software ecosystem. The market assumes CUDA dominance is unbreakable, not realizing AMD’s obstacles are fixable, given the right investment and follow-through.

## Why This Campaign Works

All past efforts failed by working in isolation:
- AMD’s promises lack developer trust.
- Developers alone have no leverage with management.
- Financial pressure without technical context leads nowhere.

Our campaign creates a feedback loop:
- Build trust: Developers define real-world requirements; AMD’s commitments get technical legitimacy.
- Create accountability: Shareholder actions and resolutions can’t be ignored or spun.
- Educate markets: We clearly explain the technical bottleneck and the scale of the business opportunity.

This is not just advocacy. It’s a framework for real change and measurable value—for developers, investors, and AMD alike.

*(For developers unfamiliar with shareholder activism tactics, see our [detailed explanation](/shareholder-activism) of how this strategy works in practice.)*

## The Investment Opportunity

- The "Nvidia Tax": NVIDIA charges up to 5x hardware cost—because it can.
- AMD's Hidden Potential: The hardware is strong; the missing piece is a seamless, developer-friendly stack.
- Exploding Demand: The AI/compute boom means any AMD software win translates into major market gains.
- Market Mispricing: The market doesn’t yet price in what happens when AMD fixes the software bottleneck. The upside is enormous for early movers. 

## Our Demands

1. **Substantial, Protected Investment**: Commit a significant, ring-fenced annual budget for ROCm/open GPU software.
2. **Leadership and Transparency**: Appoint a VP for Open Compute Software with board-level visibility; publish a roadmap and report progress every quarter.
3. **Genuine Community Engagement**: Create a developer/customer advisory board; fund hackathons, bug bounties, and innovation grants.


## Preliminary Action Plan

*This plan is a starting point—join us to shape and refine it further. But some parts of it will happen regardless of the support we gain.*
- Shareholder Action: File a non-binding resolution at AMD’s 2026 meeting. Enlist activist investor allies.
- Developer Coalition: Launch #UnlockGPU, unite developer voices, and prioritize a technical wishlist.
- Strategic Pressure: Demand quarterly progress and push for AMD to collaborate on open, cross-vendor standards (SYCL, etc.).

## How to Join
