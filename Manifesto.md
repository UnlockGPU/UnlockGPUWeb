# Manifesto: Unlock the GPU
## A Developer-Led Investor Campaign for Open Compute and AMD Shareholder Value

## Why This Matters

NVIDIA's CUDA ecosystem has monopolized the GPU computing market for over a decade, dictating both prices and the pace of innovation. Developers know the pain: AMD's promising hardware is held back by years of broken promises, limited support, and a fragmented software stack. This persistent credibility gap means that even when AMD makes technical progress, developers and the market remain skeptical—and AMD's enormous potential goes unrealized.

Every engineer who's tried to port code or build AI on AMD hardware knows this struggle. Despite recent improvements, the overwhelming sentiment is still that "NVIDIA just works" while "AMD makes it hard." Financial markets have taken note—and consistently undervalue AMD's future in AI and data center compute. There's a disconnect between what developers see as possible and what investors believe is achievable. That's why a developer-led, investor-powered movement is essential: to finally rebuild credibility, deliver real accountability, and unlock massive value.

## The Investment Opportunity

- **The "Nvidia Tax"**: NVIDIA's monopoly lets it charge up to 5x hardware cost. Enterprises, researchers, and cloud providers are eager for a real alternative.

- **AMD's Hidden Potential**: The hardware is competitive, but only a developer-first, unified, and robust software stack will unlock billions in new sales, partnerships, and ecosystem momentum.

- **Rising Demand**: AI, ML, and scientific computing are exploding. Even modest progress on AMD's stack would yield outsized returns.

- **Activist Leverage**: Unified shareholder and developer pressure can drive the management changes, focus, and substantial investment AMD needs to finally compete.

## The Credibility Gap — And How We Fix It

Years of failed efforts have left AMD with a severe trust deficit in the developer community. Even recent technical gains are viewed with skepticism, because past promises went unfulfilled and resources were too often lacking or misallocated. Our campaign directly addresses this credibility problem by:

- **Showing developer and investor unity**: This is not another press release—it's a coalition with real technical and financial weight behind it.

- **Demanding public, verifiable commitments**: We call for substantial, ring-fenced investment in GPU software, visible executive accountability, open reporting, and a unified, developer-first platform.

- **Committing to external accountability**: We pledge ongoing monitoring, campaign visibility, and coordinated proxy action—holding AMD's leadership to a new standard.

- **Rebuilding trust through real execution**: If AMD delivers on these demands—funding a dedicated software team, publishing a clear roadmap, fixing historic pain points—developers and markets will respond.

## Our Demands

1. **Substantial Dedicated Investment**: Commit to and publicly report a significant, protected annual budget for ROCm and open GPU software—matching the scale of the challenge.

2. **Leadership and Transparency**: Appoint a VP for Open Compute Software with board visibility, publish a clear software roadmap, and report progress quarterly.

3. **Community Engagement**: Form an external developer/customer advisory board and fund hackathons, bug bounties, and innovation grants.

## Preliminary Action Plan

*This plan is a starting point—join us to shape and refine it further.*

- **Draft Shareholder Resolution**: Prepare a non-binding shareholder resolution incorporating our three demands to be voted at AMD's 2026 Annual General Meeting.

- **Vote Your Shares**: Pledge support at AMD AGMs and through proxy voting. [How to vote your proxy as a retail investor](https://example.com).

- **Push for Dedicated Leadership and Budget**: Call for a VP of ROCm/Open Compute and a ring-fenced software development budget.

- **Amplify the Developer Voice**: Share pain points and success stories. Use #UnlockGPU and participate in campaign forums.

- **Monitor and Demand Progress**: Require quarterly reporting on ROCm progress, budget use, and developer satisfaction.

- **Build Strategic Alliances**: Encourage AMD to collaborate with Intel, cloud providers, and open-source leaders.

## How to Join

1. **Become a Shareholder**: Buy AMD stock via your broker.

2. **Register Support**: Sign up at UnlockGPU.org *(coming soon)* for campaign updates and coordination.

3. **Vote and Participate**: Use your proxy votes, submit and endorse proposals, and attend AGMs (virtually or in person).

4. **Shape the Agenda**: Suggest new actions, budget targets, or leadership changes through campaign channels.

## The Payoff

- **Unlock billions** in shareholder value as AMD wins market share from NVIDIA.

- **Lead a historic transformation**—ending GPU vendor lock-in and opening up compute for all.

- **Ensure the future** of AI, ML, and scientific research is built on open, competitive, and developer-friendly foundations.
