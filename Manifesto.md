# Unlock the GPU 

### A Manifesto for a developer-Led Investor Campaign for Open Compute and AMD Shareholder Value

## The Three-Part Problem

NVIDIA's CUDA monopoly has created a unique challenge for AMD: despite producing competitive GPU hardware, AMD struggles to gain market share due to a complex crisis with three distinct but interconnected dimensions:

**1. Developers Know What's Broken, But Don't Trust AMD**

Every engineer who's touched GPU computing knows the pain: AMD's hardware often delivers superior price/performance, but the software experience is fractured. Driver instability, poor CUDA compatibility, incomplete toolchains, and years of broken promises have eroded developer confidence. We know exactly what needs fixing—seamless installation, stable drivers, complete HIP/ROCm parity with CUDA, better documentation—but we've been burned too many times to believe AMD will deliver.

**2. AMD Understands the Opportunity, But Can't Rebuild Trust Alone**

AMD's leadership isn't blind to the CUDA alternative's potential. They see the billions in revenue waiting to be unlocked, the data center opportunities, the chance to break NVIDIA's stranglehold. But past software failures have created a trust deficit that traditional corporate communications can't bridge. Developers dismiss announcements as marketing, and incremental improvements get lost in the noise of accumulated frustration. AMD needs external validation and structured accountability to prove this time is different.

**3. Financial Markets Don't Understand the Technical Bottleneck**

Wall Street sees AMD's strong hardware metrics and wonders why GPU revenue lags. Financial analysts understand competitive pricing and performance benchmarks, but they don't grasp how software ecosystem gaps create an insurmountable barrier to adoption. The market understands a CUDA alternative would be valuable, but assumes AMD's repeated failures mean the technical barriers are permanent—they don't realize these are fixable software problems, not fundamental limitations.

## Why This Campaign Works

Traditional approaches have failed because they address only one dimension of the problem. AMD's internal commitments lack credibility with developers. Developer advocacy alone lacks leverage with AMD management. Financial pressure without technical understanding leads to misguided priorities.

Our campaign breaks this cycle by creating a feedback loop between all three parties:

- **Bridge the trust gap**: Developer backing gives AMD's software commitments credibility, while technical requirements are based on real-world pain points, not corporate wishful thinking
- **Provide accountability**: Shareholder resolutions and board pressure that can't be dismissed as online complaints, ensuring sustained investment and progress transparency  
- **Educate markets**: Clear communication of the technical barriers and business opportunity helps investors understand both the challenge and the massive upside

This isn't just advocacy—it's a structured pathway for AMD to rebuild trust while delivering measurable value to shareholders.

## The Investment Opportunity

- **The "Nvidia Tax"**: NVIDIA's monopoly lets it charge up to 5x over hardware
cost. Enterprises, researchers, and cloud providers desperately want a credible
alternative.

- **AMD's Hidden Potential**: AMD hardware already offers leading
price/performance. Closing the software gap—making ROCm and HIP as seamless as
CUDA—would unlock billions in new sales, data center wins, and ecosystem
momentum.

- **Exploding Demand**: AI and scientific computing growth means even modest AMD software improvements yield outsized returns.

- **Market Mispricing**: AMD's valuation doesn't reflect what happens when the software bottleneck breaks. Early investors in this transition stand to capture disproportionate returns.

## Our Demands

1. **Substantial Dedicated Investment**: Commit to and publicly report a significant, protected annual budget for ROCm and open GPU software—matching the scale of the challenge.

2. **Leadership and Transparency**: Appoint a VP for Open Compute Software with board visibility, publish a clear software roadmap, and report progress quarterly.

3. **Community Engagement**: Form an external developer/customer advisory board and fund hackathons, bug bounties, and innovation grants.

## Preliminary Action Plan

*This plan is a starting point—join us to shape and refine it further.*

- **Shareholder Action**: Draft and submit a non-binding resolution for AMD's 2026 annual meeting, engaging legal experts and activist investors (Elliott Management, Third Point) for maximum impact.

- **Developer Coalition**: Organize the #UnlockGPU campaign, engage prominent figures in GPU computing, and build a unified voice demanding specific technical improvements.

- **Strategic Pressure**: Monitor and demand quarterly progress reporting while advocating for AMD to collaborate with Intel, cloud providers, and open-source leaders on cross-vendor standards and tools.

## How to Join

### For Developers
- **Document Technical Pain Points**: Share specific ROCm/HIP issues, compatibility gaps, and missing features that block adoption
- **Contribute to Resolution Drafting**: Help define technical requirements and proposed solutions for the shareholder resolution
- **Amplify #UnlockGPU**: Share experiences and build technical consensus around needed improvements

### For Shareholders
- **Buy AMD Stock**: Purchase shares through your broker to gain voting rights
- **Vote and Engage**: Use proxy votes at AGMs, submit proposals, and attend meetings (virtual or in-person)
- **Register Support**: Sign up at UnlockGPU.org *(coming soon)* for coordination and updates

### For Activist Investors
- **Strategic Partnership**: Join forces with campaign organizers to maximize shareholder pressure and provide strategic guidance
- **Shape the Agenda**: Contribute expertise on effective resolution language, timing, media strategy, and board engagement tactics
- **Leverage Networks**: Connect the campaign with other institutional investors, analysts, and industry allies

## The Payoff

- **Unlock billions** in shareholder value as AMD wins market share from NVIDIA.

- **End GPU vendor lock-in** and open compute for all.

- **Ensure AI and scientific research** is built on open, competitive foundations.
