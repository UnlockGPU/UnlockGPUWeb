# UnlockGPU Gamer Community Campaign Plan

## 1. Objectives

- **Recruit AMD GPU gamers** as testers, advocates, and coalition members
- **Aggregate and publicize** real gamer pain points (driver bugs, crashes, missing features)
- **Demonstrate to AMD and the public** that gaming stability matters for open compute and ecosystem trust
- **Build a bridge** between "gamer pain" and "developer/AI pain"—showing it's the same root problem
- **Drive participation** in shareholder actions (petitions, votes, social media storms)

## 2. Messaging Pillars

> **"If AMD can't fix drivers for gamers, how can devs trust them for AI?"**

> **"Your bugs, crashes, and feedback can finally force AMD to listen—by joining a developer–investor coalition."**

> **"We don't just complain. We organize. And when gamers organize, companies change."**

## 3. Prerequisites

### Essential Infrastructure:
- **UnlockGPU website** with dedicated gamer section/landing page
- **Discord/Matrix server** set up with gamer-specific channels
- **Social media accounts** (Twitter/X, Reddit account with sufficient karma)
- **Google Forms/Typeform** for bug reporting and data collection
- **Basic branding assets** (logos, banners, consistent messaging)

### Team & Resources:
- **Core team member(s)** dedicated to gamer outreach (2-4 hours/week minimum)
- **Community moderators** familiar with gaming/AMD communities
- **Content creation capabilities** (writing posts, creating memes, basic graphics)
- **Legal review** of shareholder action language and data collection practices

### Research & Preparation:
- **Baseline research** on current AMD driver issues and community sentiment
- **Key influencer mapping** in gaming communities (active posters, moderators)
- **Competitor analysis** of similar grassroots tech campaigns
- **Timeline and milestone planning** (90-day roadmap minimum)

### Technical Setup:
- **Analytics tracking** for engagement metrics
- **Automated data aggregation** system for bug reports
- **Backup communication channels** (in case of platform restrictions)
- **Content calendar tools** for consistent posting schedule

## 4. Tactics & Steps

### A. Mapping and Outreach

#### Reddit Communities:
- `r/Amd`, `r/AMDHelp`, `r/AMD_Stock`, `r/AMD_GPU`
- `r/pcgaming`, `r/linux_gaming`, `r/buildapc`, `r/hardware`, `r/SteamDeck`
- **Search/monitor keywords:** "driver," "crash," "black screen," "FSR," "Adrenalin," "unstable"

#### Discord/Matrix:
- Join AMD, gaming, hardware, and Steam Deck servers
- Ask mods for `#driver-issues` or `#feedback` channels

#### PC Forums:
- Overclock.net
- Linus Tech Tips
- TechPowerUp
- Tom's Hardware
- Guru3D

### B. Initial Engagement ("Scouting and Listening")

1. **Spend 1-2 weeks** actively reading, upvoting, commenting on existing AMD pain threads
2. **Share your intent:**
   > "We're building a coalition to force AMD to listen—starting with real gamer stories. Tell us your biggest pain and let's fix this together."
3. **DM helpful users** and ask if they'd like to be early testers/advisors ("Founding Gamers")
4. **Build a starter Discord/Matrix/Telegram group** just for gamers

### C. Launch "The AMD Pain Project"

#### Weekly Pain Threads:
- **Post on relevant subreddits:**
  > "This Week's AMD Driver Pain: Post your bugs, crashes, and solutions. We'll compile and push them to AMD leadership."

#### Data Collection:
- **Google Form:** Simple "Report Your Issue" (card, OS, problem, logs/screenshots)
- **Share Collated Pain** on your site, Twitter/X, and Discord—anonymously, unless users want credit
- **Pin top bugs/threads** and update progress

### D. Highlight Progress and Leverage Collective Action

- **Celebrate wins:** If a driver update fixes something (even partially), share the news:
  > "Your complaints made this happen. Keep pushing."
- **Organize "Driver Feedback Day":** Ask everyone to file a report or upvote a GitHub issue on the same day
- **Create memes:**
  - "FSR 4 Fixed My Game—But My Driver's Still a Gamble"
  - "AMD: Great Hardware, Will the Driver Survive This Boss Fight?"

### E. Connect Gamers to the Bigger Mission

- **Share the connection:** How game stability is developer/AI trust ("Broken drivers = broken ROCm")
- **Invite participation:** Co-sign shareholder proposals or petitions
- **Run polls:** "Would you buy a share to force AMD to listen to gamers?"

### F. Reward and Recognize Early Supporters

- **"Hall of Fame"** for top bug reporters/testers
- **Offer perks:** Discord badges, profile flair, or public thank-yous
- **Publish "Gamer Impact Stories"**—highlight if someone's bug got fixed, etc.

## 5. Example Starter Posts

### Reddit/Forum Post Template:

```
Are you tired of AMD driver roulette? Want your crash reports to actually matter?

We're starting a campaign to organize gamers and developers to force AMD to fix its driver and software issues—for good.

Share your worst driver bug or gaming horror story. We'll collect them, amplify your voices, and bring them straight to AMD's boardroom (and the news).

Join us—your bug can make a difference. DM for our Discord or just comment below.
```

## 6. Metrics for Success

- **# of gamers** joining your Discord/Matrix
- **# of unique pain points/bugs** reported  
- **# of upvotes or engagement** on pain threads
- **# of signatures/petition signers** for shareholder actions
- **Visible acknowledgement or fixes** from AMD (even if small)

## 7. Tips

- **Stay positive**—never "fanboy bash" or flame. Position as "we love AMD, we want it to win—but only if it listens."
- **Credit every small win** to the community's voice
- **Be ready for skeptics and trolls**—don't engage in bad faith, focus on the mission
